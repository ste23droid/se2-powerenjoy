Purpose
The Design Document (DD) follows the redaction of the RASD. 


The main purposes of this document are: record the main design information and decisions to communicate them to some key stakeholders; identify the main architectural components of the system together with their functional description and interaction; highlight in deep the interfaces of the system and their impact on the architecture; describe the main algorithms to be implemented; provide a view of the user interfaces that goes beyond the mockups provided in the RASD.


In order to show which are the main modules of the system and their interaction to create the its whole structure, specific UML diagrams will be provided.


The intended audience of this document are: developers, designers, project managers, quality assurance people and testers. This document can be used as a basis for the developers to start the implementation phase.


Scope
The aim of the system is to manage the PowerEnjoy car-sharing service, which only employs electric cars. Architectural styles and design patterns will be used when reasonable to provide a structure of the system based on well known solutions, also to reduce the development costs during the implementation phase.


Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations

Document Structure
This document has been structured in this way:
-Section 1: Introduction: this first section provides the introductory information about the purposes of the DD, its structure, and about the the system to be developed.
-Section 2: Architectural Design: 
-Section 3: Algorithm Design: this section will be used to present the most important algorithms designed to fullfill the goals of the system. The description will be as much implementation independent as possible.
-Section 4: User Interface Design: this section will provide a refinement of the mockups presented in the RASD, to be considered as user interfaces.
-Section 5: Requirements Traceability: this section will show how the design decisions taken in this document match with the requirements in the RASD.
