OVERALL DESCRIPTION


PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE 
The proposed solution for the system of PowerEnjoy won’t have to rely or to be interfaced with a previous car-sharing system of the same company. The system core functionalities will be developed from scratch, however part of the offered functionalities will rely on external services for these main reasons:
1. Some functionalities cannot work without interfacing with specific databases or informative systems
2. Reduce development costs by relying on well known  APIs already present in the market
3. Guarantee the portability of the system on multiple platforms


The system will be developed having in mind as core devices: mobile devices (Android, iOS) and car touchscreen. However efforts will be done during the development to try to rely the least as possible to native Android SDK APIs or to Swift SDK APIs, so that a future development of a web application for PowerEnjoy won’t need much changes in the internal logics of the system.


* USER INTERFACES
        The interface of the system on mobile devices will be developed to support 
screen devices ranging from 3 inches diagonal and up, to support both devices with small screen sizes and phablets. The interface should also support a correct visualization even when the smartphone screen is rotated (orientation change).
After the user is logged in, the user won’t be redirected immediately on a map activity to find and reserve available cars, he/she will be redirected on a menu activity. This decision will help in the future if our customer will ask us to add new functionalities like: support the user to change his/her personal informations, support the user to pay PowerEnjoy when there are some debts with the company since one or more payments on the credit card of the user have failed.
The interface of the system on the car’s screen will be developed to be simple and immediate.


* HARDWARE INTERFACES
        The main hardware interface to take into account for the S2B is the interaction 
with the hardware of every car. The system shall be able, as expressed further on the Requirements section, to know the status of the car and control some of its function using a software interface implemented on the vehicles.


* SOFTWARE INTERFACES
        The system will use the following external services to provide part of its 
functionalities:
* -Name : Google Maps
                -Mnemonic: MapsService
                -Source: https://developers.google.com/maps/
* -Name : -----
        -Mnemonic: BillingService
        -Source: -----


PRODUCT FUNCTIONS
The main functionalities that will be provided by the S2B considering also the functionalities provided in part through external interfacing are the followings:
* Guest registration
* User login
* Visualization of available cars on a map of the city
* Find available cars inside the city area
* Reserve available cars inside the city area
* Unlock a reserved car through smartphone mobile application
* Computation of the best power safe area to save money for the user
* Cost and discount computation for every car reservation
* Car reservation payment handling


USER CHARACTERISTICS
The usage of the S2B will not require users with a particular educational level, experience or technical expertise. Every user who knows how to use applications on a smartphone device, how to enable an internet connection, how to enable GPS and who is familiar in providing payment informations on e-commerce websites, has enough expertise to use the S2B easily. In order to guarantee more usability of the software, a design based on the guidelines for Android and iOS applications will be adopted where possible.


CONSTRAINTS
1. REGULATORY POLICIES
        The S2B will ask users for permissions to acquire their GPS position.
1. HARDWARE LIMITATIONS
        The hardware limitations for the mobile application are the followings:
* 3G connection enabled
* GPS connection enabled
* Memory to download the application package
* Memory to install the application package
1. PARALLEL OPERATIONS
        The S2B shall support parallel requests by multiple users for all the functionalities 
that can be provided to final users like login, research of available cars, car 
reservation and so on.






ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES
We assume that these properties hold in the analyzed world:
DOMAIN ASSUMPTIONS


* The personal informations provided by the user during the registration procedure correspond to the truth. 
* The set of the safe areas is initialized in the S2B at startup-time
* Every safe-area has a predefined number of parking slots
* The safe areas are far enough from each other such that each safe-area can be identified by a unique GPS coordinate and a radius of variable dimension
* Every car is identified by a unique license plate
* The number of available cars of the company is less than or equal to the sum of all the parking slots in all the safe areas, considering both normal safe areas and power safe areas
* A user won’t drive a car without a valid driving license 
* A user cannot let another user to use the car he has reserved by providing its PIN to him/her
* The GPS data are always correct
* Every car has a GPS module that is always on
* Every car has a 3G module that is always on
* The software on board of the car is always on even when the screen on the car is turned off to save battery energy
* All the sensors in the cars work correctly
* A car with empty battery or occurring in a mechanical failure will always be able to communicate to the system
* A user occurring in a car failure or emptying the battery of his/her reserved car will stop using that car as soon as possible
* The unique PIN received back by a user after the registration will always be known by the user
* The mobile phone used by guests and users it’s provided with GPS technology and with at least 3G connectivity technology
* Guests and users cannot interact with the functionalities of the S2B through the mobile application without both GPS and 3G connection enabled
* Every parking slot in a power safe area has a dedicated and working power plug


TEXT ASSUMPTIONS
* There is not a previous system, the system will be developed from scratch
* The main device used by users to access the functionalities of the S2B it’s a mobile device, however part of the interaction between the user and the S2B happens through the screen on board of every car
* The PowerEnjoy company has already bought all the electric cars that will be used by the future users. We have to develop the software of the car which interacts with the user through a screen in the car and with the car hardware
* The user cannot cancel a reservation of a car. We assume that our customers wants to encourage the usage of the electric cars in the short time. In fact a user can only  reserve an available car at most 1 hour before the pick-up time, so we think that there is an high probability that a user performing a reservation of a car will actually be very interested in exploiting that reservation.
* We assume that a user is considered near a car when its GPS position is inside a radius of 10 meters starting from the car GPS location
* We assume that for users :“find the locations of available cars within a certain distance from their current location or from a specified address” shall be intended as the fact that only users inside the city area should be able to find available cars in the whole city area starting from their GPS location or by inserting an address inside the city area.
        We’ve made this text assumption since we think that if a user manages to find and
then reserve a car while still outside the city area, during the time needed to reach 
the reserved car, a reservation by another user will probably happen.
* We assume that the battery cited in the text is considered as the electric car tank. In fact in the real world every electric car has two main batteries: the battery array which serves as a tank and a service battery which provides the energy necessary for the functioning of all the electrical equipments in the car even when the battery array is empty. The service battery provides energy to guarantee the lock/unlock of the car, the ignition of the engine, the work of the ECU and so on.
* When a car is plugged to a power plug inside a power safe area, the battery array recharges and the service battery recharges as well
* We assume from the text that every car has at least 3 seats
* A car is available only if it is inside a safe area
* An available car is locked
* The safe areas are distributed uniformly inside the city area (otherwise cars cannot be distributed uniformly in the city)
* A vehicle not owned by PowerEnjoy cannot be left in a parking slot inside a safe area
