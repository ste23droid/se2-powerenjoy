OVERALL DESCRIPTION


PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE 
The proposed solution for the system of PowerEnjoy won’t have to rely or to be interfaced with a previous car-sharing system of the same company. The system core functionalities will be developed from scratch, however part of the offered functionalities will rely on external services for these main reasons:
1. Some functionalities cannot work without interfacing with specific databases or informative systems
2. Reduce development costs by relying on well known APIs already present in the market
3. Guarantee the portability of the system on multiple platforms


The system will be developed having in mind as core devices: mobile devices (Android, iOS) and car touchscreen. However efforts will be done during the development to try to rely the least as possible to native Android SDK APIs for Android or to Swift SDK APIs for iOS, so that a future development of a web browser version for our web application for PowerEnjoy won’t need much changes in its internal logics.


* USER INTERFACES
        The interface of the system on mobile devices will be developed to support 
screen devices ranging from 3 inches diagonal and up, to support both devices with small screen sizes and phablets. The interface should also support a correct visualization even when the smartphone screen is rotated (orientation change).
After the user is logged in, the user won’t be redirected immediately on a map activity to find and reserve available cars, on the contrary he will be redirected on a menu activity. This decision will help in the future if our customer will ask us to add new functionalities like: support the user to change his personal informations, support the user to pay PowerEnjoy when there are some debts with the company (since one or more payments on the credit card of the user have failed)
The interface of the system on the car’s on board screen will be developed to be simple and immediate.


* HARDWARE INTERFACES
        The interaction with the hardware of every car is done through a pre-installed 
hardware board that was put inside every car by the company from which our 
customer has bought the cars.
Our S2B will only use with the software interface provided by this hardware board to 
interact with the car.


* SOFTWARE INTERFACES
        The system will use the following external services to provide part of its 
functionalities:


* -Name: VehicleInterface
                -Mnemonic: Car
                -Source: Paper on the Green Move project.


* -Name : Google Maps
                -Mnemonic: MapsService
                -Source: https://developers.google.com/maps/

PRODUCT FUNCTIONS
The main functionalities that will be provided by the S2B, considering also the functionalities provided in part through external interfacings, are the followings:
* Guest registration
* User login
* Visualization of available cars on a map of the city
* Find available cars inside the city area
* Reserve available cars inside the city area
* Unlock a reserved car through a smartphone mobile web application
* Computation of the best safe area or power safe area as a destination to save money for the user
* Cost and discount computation for every car reservation
* Car reservation payment handling


USER CHARACTERISTICS
The usage of the S2B will not require users with a particular educational level, experience or technical expertise. Every user who knows how to use applications on a smartphone device, how to enable an internet connection, how to enable GPS and who is familiar in providing payment informations on e-commerce websites, has enough expertise to interact with the S2B easily. In order to guarantee more usability of the software, a design based on the design guidelines for Android and iOS applications will be adopted where possible.


CONSTRAINTS
1. REGULATORY POLICIES
        The S2B will ask users for permissions to acquire their GPS position.
1. HARDWARE LIMITATIONS
        The hardware limitations for the mobile web application are the followings:
* 3G connectivity
* GPS connectivity
* Memory to download the application package
* Memory to install the application package
1. PARALLEL OPERATIONS
        The S2B shall support parallel requests by multiple users for all the functionalities 
that can be provided to final users like: login, research of available cars, car 
reservation and so on.




ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES:
We assume that these properties hold in the analyzed world:


TEXT ASSUMPTIONS
* [T1] There is not a previous system, the system will be developed from scratch.
* [T2] The main device used by users and operators to access the functionalities of the S2B it’s a mobile device, however part of the interaction between the user and the S2B happens also through the screen on board of every car.
* [T3] The PowerEnjoy company has already bought all the electric cars that will be used by our future users. We have to develop the software of the car which interacts through a software interface with the car hardware, and with the user through a screen on board.
* [T4] The user cannot cancel a reservation of a car. We assume that our customers wants to encourage the usage of the electric cars in the short time. In fact a user can only  reserve an available car at most 1 hour before the pick-up time, so we think that there is an high probability that a user performing a reservation of a car will actually be very interested in exploiting that reservation. Furthermore our customers are asking us to apply a fee (1 EUR) to the user if a reserved car is not picked-up, which we think is a small fee considering the money lost by the missed usage of that car.
* [T5] We assume that the battery cited in the text is considered as the electric car tank. In fact in the real world every electric car has two main batteries: the battery array which serves as a tank and a service battery which provides the energy necessary for the functioning of all the electrical equipments in the car. 
* [T6] A car is available only if it is inside a safe area.
* [T7] An available car is locked.
* [T8] We assume from the text that every car of the company has at least 3 seats


DOMAIN ASSUMPTIONS
* [D1] Every car has a GPS module that is always on.
* [D2] Every car has a 3G module that is always on.
* [D3] The S2B on board of a car is always on even when the screen on board of that car is turned off to save service battery energy.
* [D4] Inside every car there is a low-level hardware board which is connected to the CAN-bus of the car. This board provides a software interface that can be used by our S2B to get informations from that car and to control the actuators of that car.
* [D5] All the sensors in the cars work correctly.
* [D6] Every car is always localizable using GPS.
* [D7] The GPS data are always correct.
* [D8] A car occurring in a car failure will always be able to communicate to the system.
* [D9] A user occurring in a car failure during the usage of his reserved car will stop using that car as soon as possible.
* [D10] The mobile device used by guests, users and operators it’s always connected to the S2B with GPS technology and Internet connection (3G connectivity technology or WiFi).
* [D11] The set of safe areas is initialized in the S2B at startup-time.
* [D12] Every safe-area has a predefined number of parking slots.
* [D13] The safe areas are far enough from each other such that each safe-area can be identified by a unique GPS coordinate and a radius of variable dimension.
* [D14] Every parking slot in a power safe area has a dedicated and working power plug.
* [D15] When a car is plugged to a power plug inside a power safe area, the battery array recharges and the service battery recharges as well.
* [D16] The number of available cars of the company is less than or equal to the sum of all the parking slots in all the safe areas, considering both normal safe areas and power safe areas.
* [D17] The safe areas are distributed uniformly inside the city area:
we make this assumption otherwise the cars cannot be distributed uniformly in the city.
* [D18] A vehicle not owned by PowerEnjoy cannot be left in a parking slot inside a safe area.
* [D19] Every operator is already assigned to a predefined email and password by the company, they don’t need to register to the system.
* [D20] Every operator checks periodically if there are unavailable cars. We assume this since they’re paid to do the maintenance.
* [D21] An operator that has set a car as under maintenance will actually manage to fix it and then set it back to available.
* [D22] Every car is identified by a unique license plate.
* [D23] The personal informations provided by the user during the registration procedure correspond to the truth. 
* [D24] A user won’t drive a car of the company without a valid driving license.
* [D25] The unique PIN received back by a user at the end of his registration procedure will always be known by that user.
* [D26] A user cannot let another user to use the car he has reserved by providing its credentials and personal PIN to him.
