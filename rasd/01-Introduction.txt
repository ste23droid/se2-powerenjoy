INTRODUCTION


Abstract
The Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) follows the redaction of the Feasibility Study document. This document aims to provide a model for the system which is aligned with the needs of the customers, to highlight the goals and limitations of the S2B, to provide a complete description of the system in terms of functional and non-functional requirements and to describe some typical scenarios that will then lead to the specification of typical use cases. 
This document leads stakeholders from some initial goals or objectives of the S2B to structured and more formal requirements.
The intended audience of this document are all the stakeholders which directly or indirectly have an interest on the system: the customers which are paying for the commission of this software, the final users that will use this software, the developers and designers that have to implement the system and the requirements analysts that have to implement the requirements. This document can also be used as a contractual basis between the customers and the developers.


Purpose
The aim of the project is to develop PowerEnjoy, a digital management system for a car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric cars.


As every regular car-sharing service, the system guarantees some basic functionalities: 
users can locate and reserve an electric car, after having registered and logged into the system. The S2B will discourage users to make reservations that won’t be respected, since in this case the car are not used and this causes a business damage to our customers. The users can communicate to the system that they are near a reserved car to allow its unlock. During their journey on the car, the users will pay a given amount of money per minute, while informed of the current charges; the users are stop being charged when the car is parked in one of the predefined safe areas and the car will automatically be locked after the exit of the users.


In addition to standard car-sharing services, the system aims to incentivise users which use properly the cars and to optimize the distribution of the cars in the city. This incentives are done by providing discounts on the last ride made by the user. The users will obtain a discount when they share their car with other passengers, when they leave no more than half of the battery empty and when they plug the car into a power grid to enable battery recharge. These discounts aim to reduce the maintenance costs of our customers, to guarantee that future users will be able to use a car with enough battery autonomy and to encourage users to use the service again. On the contrary, unworthy behaviours from the users that may prejudice the future users’ experience will cause an extra charge.


Finally, in order to guarantee a uniform distribution of cars in the city, the users can access a money saving option by accepting as destination a safe area dictated by the system.




Goals
The overall, high level objectives which provide the motivations for the system in the world are the followings:


* G1: The system shall allow users to find available cars and reserve them.
        This is the main goal to be fulfilled by the S2B. All the operations to 
            achieve this goal will be done by final users through a mobile application
* G2: The system shall guarantee the usage of the cars
        This goals aims to guarantee to users the usage of reserved cars and the 
access to the reserved cars through a mobile application
* G3: The system shall guarantee a uniform distribution of the cars in the city.
        This goals aims to exploit the usage of the cars by the users as much as possible
and to incentivize new users to sign up to PowerEnjoy
* G4: The system shall encourage users to use properly the reserved cars 
        This goal aims to incentivize users to use properly the fleet of cars provided by the 
company to reduce the maintenance time of the cars.


All the goals contribute together to guarantee the main goal for PowerEnjoy, which is that the cars are used as much as possible by the users.


Scope
In order to make a first analysis of the application domain, we have followed the concepts and ideas provided in the paper by M. Jackson & P. Zave on “The World and the Machine”.
The application domain can be divided in three main parts: the World, the Shared Phenomena and the Machine. In the World there are all the 


Actual System
Our customers don’t have by now a software for the management of the car-sharing service which they would like to provide, so we assume that the S2B will not incorporate any previous legacy software and will be developed from scratch. However to system will interact with external software to support part of its functionalities. More details about external interfaces will be explained in the Section 3 of this document.


Actors
The main physical actors involved in the interactions with the S2B are the following:
* Guest: all the guest users can only see the introductory login page and 
        decide to register to the system by following the registration procedure
* User: this users, after a successfull login, can access to all the main functionalities of the S2B, among which: research of available cars inside the city, reservation of an available car, unlocking of a reserved car.


Definitions, acronyms, abbreviations


Definitions
* Actor: class of people or system that interact with the S2B
* Guest: physical person whose email is not known by the S2B
* User: physical person whose credentials are known by the S2B
* Credentials: email and password
* Car: an electric car of the PowerEnjoy company
* Safe Area : private area owned by the company. Each safe area is made of multiple parking slots
* Power safe area: it’s a special kind of safe area where each parking slot has a dedicated power plug that can be used to recharge a car
* City area: the city area is the set of all the GPS positions within the boundaries of the city
* Environment: the world in which reside the goals and domain assumptions of this software to be
* PIN: unique password received by the user from the S2B at the end of the registration procedure. This password will be then used to access to the system. This password should not be confused with the password used by the user to perform the login.
* Car failure: mechanical problem in the car. Examples of car failures are: battery damaged, engine broken, flat tires, and failures caused by accidents
* Service battery: battery inside the car which provides the energy needed for the functioning of all the electrical equipment in the car. This battery can work even when the main battery of the car is empty
* Battery (Battery Array):  is the energy tank of the car

Overview
This document has been structured by following the IEEE Std 830-1998 with some minor modifications. The whole document is divided in four sections.
* Section 1: Introduction, this section presents the main goals and relevant actors of the S2B. This section is audienced to all the stakeholder which have a legitimate interest in the system
* Section 2: Overall Description, this section provides more informations about the boundaries of the S2B and the interactions between the S2B and external interfaces. It will also highlight the domain and text assumptions for S2B. This part is audienced to all the stakeholders.
* Section 3: Specific Requirements, this section is the body of the whole RASD. It provides more informations about all the aspects in Section 2 and is mainly audienced to the developers. This section provides some mockups for the interfaces within the boundaries of the S2B, some informations about the external services used and also some scenarios of the use of the software system with related use cases and UML diagrams. In this section all the goals of the S2B will be investigated deeply and for every goal a list of functional and non-functional requirements will be presented.
* Section 4: Appendix, this sections provides the models of the system created using Alloy. Alloy will be used to verify some critical aspects of the S2B.
