INTRODUCTION


Abstract
The Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) follows the redaction of the Feasibility Study document. This document aims to provide a model for the system which is aligned with the needs of the customers, to highlight the goals and limitations of the S2B, to provide a complete description of the system in terms of functional and non-functional requirements and to describe some typical scenarios that will then lead to the specification of typical use cases. 
This document leads stakeholders from some initial goals or objectives of the S2B to structured and more formal requirements.
The intended audience of this document are all the stakeholders which directly or indirectly have an interest on the system: the customers which are paying for the commission of this software, the final users that will use this software, the developers and designers that have to implement the system and the requirements analysts that have to implement the requirements. This document can also be used as a contractual basis between the customers and the developers.


Purpose
The aim of the project is to develop PowerEnjoy, a digital management system for a car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric cars.


As every regular car-sharing service, the system guarantees some basic functionalities: 
users can locate and reserve an electric car, after having registered and logged into the system. The S2B will discourage users to make reservations that won’t be respected, since in this case the car are not used and this causes a business damage to our customers. The users can communicate to the system that they are near a reserved car to allow its unlock. During their journey on the car, the users will pay a given amount of money per minute, while informed of the current charges; the users are stop being charged when the car is parked in one of the predefined safe areas and the car will automatically be locked after the exit of the users.


In addition to standard car-sharing services, the system aims to incentivise users which use properly the cars and to optimize the distribution of the cars in the city. This incentives are done by providing discounts on the last ride made by the user. The users will obtain a discount when they share their car with other passengers, when they leave no more than half of the battery empty and when they plug the car into a power grid to enable battery recharge. These discounts aim to reduce the maintenance costs of our customers, to guarantee that future users will be able to use a car with enough battery autonomy and to encourage users to use the service again. On the contrary, unworthy behaviours from the users that may prejudice the future users’ experience will cause an extra charge.


Finally, in order to guarantee a uniform distribution of cars in the city, the users can access a money saving option by accepting as destination a safe area dictated by the system.




Goals
The main goals that PowerEnjoy should fullfill for our customers are the followings:
* G1: The system shall allow registered users to find available cars and reserve them.
        This is the main goal to be fullfilled by the S2B. All the operations to 
            achieve this goal will be done by final users through a mobile application
* G2: The system shall guarantee the usage of the cars.
        This goals aims to guarantee to registered users the usage of reserved cars and to 
access to the reserved cars through a mobile application
* G3: The system shall guarantee a uniform distribution of the cars in the city.
        This goals aims to exploit as much as possible the usage of the cars by the users 
and to incentivize new users to enroll to PowerEnjoy
* G4: The system shall encourage registered users to use properly the reserved cars 
        This goal aims to incentivize users to use properly the fleet of cars provided by the 
company to reduce the maintenance time of the cars.


Scope
In order to make a first analysis of the application domain, we have followed the concepts and ideas provided in the paper by M. Jackson & P. Zave on “The World and the Machine”.
The application domain can be divided in three main parts: the World, the Shared Phenomena and the Machine. In the World there are all the 


Actual System
Our customers don’t have by now a software for the management of the car-sharing service which they would like to provide, so we assume that the S2B will not incorporate any previous legacy software and will be developed from scratch. However to system will interact with external software to support part of the functionalities. More details about external interfaces will be explained in the Section 3 of this document.


Actors
The main actors involved in the interactions with the S2B are the following:
* Guest User: all the guest users can only see the introductory login page and 
        decide to register to the system by following the registration procedure
* Registered Users: this users, after a successfull login, can access to all the main functionalities of the S2B, among which: research of available cars inside the city, reservation of an available car, unlocking of a reserved car.

Overview
This document has been structured by following the IEEE Std 830-1998 with some minor modifications. The whole document is divided in four sections.
* Section 1: Introduction, this section presents the main goals and users of the S2B. This section is audienced to all the stakeholder which have a legitimate interest in the system
* Section 2: Overall Description, this section provides more informations about the boundaries of the S2B and the interactions between the S2B and external interfaces. This part is audienced to all the stakeholders
* Section 3: Specific Requirements, this section provides more informations about all the aspects in Section 2 and is mainly audienced to the developers
* Section 4: Appendix, this sections provides the models of the system created using Alloy
